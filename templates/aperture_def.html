  <p class="lead text-center mb-4">
    The aperture size is measured using an "f-stop" number, written as f/ followed by a number (for example, f/2.8 or f/16).
    The f-stop number describes the ratio of the lens's focal length to the size of the aperture opening.
  </p>

  <p class="lead text-center mb-4">
    A **lower f-stop** (like f/1.8) means the aperture is **wide open**, allowing a lot of light in and creating a shallow depth of field.
    A **higher f-stop** (like f/16) means the aperture is **stopped down**, letting in less light and making more of the image stay in focus.
  </p>

  <p class="lead text-center mb-4">
    Common f-stop numbers you might see are f/1.4, f/2, f/2.8, f/4, f/5.6, f/8, f/11, and f/16.

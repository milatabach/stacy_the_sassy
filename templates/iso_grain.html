  <h1 class="text-center mb-4">ISO and Grain</h1>

  <p class="lead text-center mb-4">
    When you increase ISO to make your pictures brighter, you also introduce grain, which is called "noise."
    While a higher ISO helps capture images in low light, it comes at the cost of reduced image quality.
  </p>

  <p class="lead text-center mb-4">
    To get the best quality, you should always keep your ISO levels as low as possible, and instead adjust your aperture or shutter speed first to brighten the photo.
    A good ISO range for clean, sharp images is usually between 100 and 1600, depending on your lighting conditions and camera.
